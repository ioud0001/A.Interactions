#Introduction 
This project tests the interactions of the touch features of a device. 

##Milestones: 
I completed the map, and the contacts, and the tap and double tap works 

##Ongoing changes: 
I will continue to fix the modal save to local storage from the JSON file and the output of a contact's information when that contact is clicked. 

##Scripts: 
- Everything is in main.js. 
- I have the Geolocation inside geo.js;
- Contacts are loaded through the getcontacts.js. 
- I have the event listeners loaded inside the "get contacts" - for some reason the app.init would not work if I added it after the getContacts method went through so I had to call it into the getcontact.js file. 

Please note that this project is still in progress.
